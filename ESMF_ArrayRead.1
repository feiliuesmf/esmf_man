  28.5.27 ESMF_ArrayRead - Read Array data from a file

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_ArrayRead(array, fileName, variableName, &
     timeslice, iofmt, rc)
     ! We need to terminate the strings on the way to C++

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Array),      intent(inout)         :: array
     character(*),          intent(in)            :: fileName
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     character(*),          intent(in),  optional :: variableName
     integer,               intent(in),  optional :: timeslice
     type(ESMF_IOFmt_Flag), intent(in),  optional :: iofmt
     integer,               intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Read Array data from file and put it into an ESMF_Array object. For
   this API to be functional, the environment variable ESMF_PIO should be
   set to either "internal" or "external" when the ESMF library is built.
   Please see the section on Data I/O, [1100]38.2.

   Limitations:
     * Not supported in ESMF_COMM=mpiuni mode.

   The arguments are:

   array
          The ESMF_Array object in which the read data is returned.

   fileName
          The name of the file from which Array data is read. If this is a
          multi-tile Array, then fileName must contain exactly one
          instance of "*"; this is a placeholder that will be replaced by
          the tile number, with each tile being read from a separate file.
          (For example, for a fileName of "myfile*.nc", tile 1 will be
          read from "myfile1.nc", tile 2 from "myfile2.nc", etc.) (This
          handling of the fileName for multi-tile I/O is subject to
          change.)

   [variableName]
          Variable name in the file; default is the "name" of Array. Use
          this argument only in the I/O format (such as NetCDF) that
          supports variable name. If the I/O format does not support this
          (such as binary format), ESMF will return an error code.

   [timeslice]
          The time-slice number of the variable read from file.

   [iofmt]
          The I/O format. Please see Section [1101]54.28 for the list of
          options. If not present, defaults to ESMF_IOFMT_NETCDF.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
