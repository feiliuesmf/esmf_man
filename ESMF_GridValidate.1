  31.6.56 ESMF_GridValidate - Validate Grid internals

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_GridValidate(grid, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Grid), intent(in)              :: grid
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,         intent(out),  optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Validates that the Grid is internally consistent. Note that one of the
   checks that the Grid validate does is the Grid status. Currently, the
   validate will return an error if the grid is not at least
   ESMF_GRIDSTATUS_COMPLETE. This means that if a Grid was created with
   the ESMF_GridEmptyCreate method, it must also have been finished with
   ESMF_GridEmptyComplete() to be valid. If a Grid was created with
   another create call it should automatically have the correct status
   level to pass the status part of the validate. The Grid validate at
   this time doesn't check for the presence or consistency of the Grid
   coordinates. The method returns an error code if problems are found.

   The arguments are:

   grid
          Specified ESMF_Grid object.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
