   INTERFACE:
     ! Private name; call using ESMF_FieldBundleAdd()
     subroutine ESMF_FieldBundleAddList(fieldbundle, fieldList, &
       multiflag, relaxedflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(inout) :: fieldbundle
     type(ESMF_Field), intent(in) :: fieldList(:)
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical, intent(in), optional :: multiflag
     logical, intent(in), optional :: relaxedflag
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Add Field(s) to a FieldBundle. It is an error if fieldList contains
   Fields that match by name Fields already contained in fieldbundle when
   multiflag is set to .false. and relaxedflag is set to .false..

   fieldbundle
          ESMF_FieldBundle to be added to.

   fieldList
          List of ESMF_Field objects to be added.

   [multiflag]
          A setting of .true. allows multiple items with the same name to
          be added to ESMF_FieldBundle. For .false. added items must have
          unique names. The default setting is .false..

   [relaxedflag]
          A setting of .true. indicates a relaxed definition of "add"
          under multiflag=.false. mode, where it is not an error if
          fieldList contains items with names that are also found in
          ESMF_FieldBundle. The ESMF_FieldBundle is left unchanged for
          these items. For .false. this is treated as an error condition.
          The default setting is .false..

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
