  21.7.14 ESMF_StateReconcile - Reconcile State data across all PETs in a VM

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_StateReconcile(state, vm, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_State),            intent(inout)         :: state
     type(ESMF_VM),               intent(in),  optional :: vm
     integer,                     intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Must be called for any ESMF_State which contains ESMF objects that have
   not been created on all the PETs of the currently running
   ESMF_Component. For example, if a coupler is operating on data which
   was created by another component that ran on only a subset of the
   couplers PETs, the coupler must make this call first before operating
   on any data inside that ESMF_State. After calling ESMF_StateReconcile
   all PETs will have a common view of all objects contained in this
   ESMF_State.

   This call is collective across the specified VM.

   The arguments are:

   state
          ESMF_State to reconcile.

   [vm]
          ESMF_VM for this ESMF_Component. By default, it is set to the
          current vm.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
