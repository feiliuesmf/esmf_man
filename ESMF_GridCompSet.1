   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        7.1.0r
                Added arguments gridList, mesh, meshList, locstream,
                locstreamList, xgrid, and xgridList. These arguments add
                support for holding references to multiple geom objects,
                either of the same type, or different type, in the same
                ESMF_GridComp object.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Sets or resets information about an ESMF_GridComp.

   The arguments are:

   gridcomp
          ESMF_GridComp to change.

   [grid]
          Associate an ESMF_Grid object with the gridcomp component. This
          is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF library
          code does not access the grid object. The grid argument is
          mutually exclusive with the gridList argument. If both arguments
          are provided, the routine will fail, and an error is returned in
          rc. By default, i.e. if neither grid nor gridList are provided,
          the ESMF_Grid association of the incoming gridcomp component
          remains unchanged.

   [gridList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_Grid objects with the gridcomp
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the gridList object. The
          gridList argument is mutually exclusive with the grid argument.
          If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an
          error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither grid nor
          gridList are provided, the ESMF_Grid association of the incoming
          gridcomp component remains unchanged.

   [mesh]
          Associate an ESMF_Mesh object with the gridcomp component. This
          is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF library
          code does not access the mesh object. The mesh argument is
          mutually exclusive with the meshList argument. If both arguments
          are provided, the routine will fail, and an error is returned in
          rc. By default, i.e. if neither mesh nor meshList are provided,
          the ESMF_Mesh association of the incoming gridcomp component
          remains unchanged.

   [meshList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_Mesh objects with the gridcomp
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the meshList object. The
          meshList argument is mutually exclusive with the mesh argument.
          If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an
          error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither mesh nor
          meshList are provided, the ESMF_Mesh association of the incoming
          gridcomp component remains unchanged.

   [locstream]
          Associate an ESMF_LocStream object with the gridcomp component.
          This is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF
          library code does not access the locstream object. The locstream
          argument is mutually exclusive with the locstreamList argument.
          If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an
          error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither locstream
          nor locstreamList are provided, the ESMF_LocStream association
          of the incoming gridcomp component remains unchanged.

   [locstreamList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_LocStream objects with the gridcomp
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the locstreamList object.
          The locstreamList argument is mutually exclusive with the
          locstream argument. If both arguments are provided, the routine
          will fail, and an error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if
          neither locstream nor locstreamList are provided, the
          ESMF_LocStream association of the incoming gridcomp component
          remains unchanged.

   [xgrid]
          Associate an ESMF_XGrid object with the gridcomp component. This
          is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF library
          code does not access the xgrid object. The xgrid argument is
          mutually exclusive with the xgridList argument. If both
          arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an error is
          returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither xgrid nor xgridList
          are provided, the ESMF_XGrid association of the incoming
          gridcomp component remains unchanged.

   [xgridList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_XGrid objects with the gridcomp
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the xgridList object. The
          xgridList argument is mutually exclusive with the xgrid
          argument. If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail,
          and an error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither
          xgrid nor xgridList are provided, the ESMF_XGrid association of
          the incoming gridcomp component remains unchanged.

   [config]
          An already-created ESMF_Config object to be attached to the
          component. If both config and configFile arguments are
          specified, config takes priority.

   [configFile]
          The filename of an ESMF_Config format file. If specified, a new
          ESMF_Config object is created and attached to the component. The
          configFile file is opened and associated with the new config
          object. If both config and configFile arguments are specified,
          config takes priority.

   [clock]
          Set the private clock for this ESMF_GridComp.

   [name]
          Set the name of the ESMF_GridComp.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
