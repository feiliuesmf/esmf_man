  47.3.16 ESMF_ConfigLoadFile - Load resource file into Config object memory

   INTERFACE:
     subroutine ESMF_ConfigLoadFile(config, filename, &
       delayout, & ! DEPRECATED ARGUMENT
       unique, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_Config),   intent(inout)         :: config
       character(len=*),    intent(in)            :: filename
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
       type(ESMF_DELayout), intent(in),  optional :: delayout  ! DEPRECATED ARGU
MENT
       logical,             intent(in),  optional :: unique
       integer,             intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        8.5.0
                Added support for loading basic YAML files.
                Marked argument delayout as deprecated. This argument was
                never used internally, and it is unclear what the original
                intention was.

   DESCRIPTION:

   The resource file named filename is loaded into memory. Both the
   classic Config file format, described in this document, and the YAML
   file format are supported. YAML support is limited to a small subset of
   the full YAML language specification, allowing access through the
   classic Config API. Specifically, in YAML mode, the top level is
   expected to be a mapping (dictionary) of scalar keys to the following
   value options:
     * Scalars
     * List of scalars
     * List of lists of scalars

   All other YAML constructs are silently ignored when loaded through this
   interface. Constructs successfully ingested become available in the
   config object, and can be accessed via the regular ESMF_Config methods.

   The arguments are:

   config
          Already created ESMF_Config object.

   filename
          Name of the configuration file. Files ending in .yaml, .yml, or
          any combination of upper and lower case letters that can be
          mapped to these two options, are interpreted as YAML files. All
          other names are interpreted as classic Config files.

   [delayout]
          ! DEPRECATED ARGUMENT ESMF_DELayout associated with this config
          object. This argument is not currently used.

   [unique]
          If specified as true, uniqueness of labels are checked and error
          code set if duplicates found.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
