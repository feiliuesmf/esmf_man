  33.4.16 ESMF_MeshFreeMemory - Remove a Mesh and its memory

   INTERFACE:
       subroutine ESMF_MeshFreeMemory(mesh, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Mesh), intent(inout)        :: mesh
     integer,        intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   This call removes the portions of mesh which contain connection and
   coordinate information. After this call, Fields build on mesh will no
   longer be usable as part of an ESMF_FieldRegridStore() operation.
   However, after this call Fields built on mesh can still be used in an
   ESMF_FieldRegrid() operation if the routehandle was generated
   beforehand. New Fields may also be built on mesh after this call.

   The arguments are:

   mesh
          Mesh object whose memory is to be freed.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
