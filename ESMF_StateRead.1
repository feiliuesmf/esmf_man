  21.7.13 ESMF_StateRead - Read data items from a file into a State

   INTERFACE:
       subroutine ESMF_StateRead(state, fileName, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_State), intent(inout) :: state
       character (len=*), intent(in) :: fileName
       integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Currently limited to read in all Arrays from a NetCDF file and add them
   to a State object. Future releases will enable more items of a State to
   be read from a file of various formats.

   Only PET 0 reads the file; the States in other PETs remain empty.
   Currently, the data is not decomposed or distributed; each PET has only
   1 DE and only PET 0 contains data after reading the file. Future
   versions of ESMF will support data decomposition and distribution upon
   reading a file. See Section [303]21.3.7 for an example.

   Note that the third party NetCDF library must be installed. For more
   details, see the "ESMF Users Guide", "Building and Installing the ESMF,
   Third Party Libraries, NetCDF" and the website
   http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf.

   The arguments are:

   state
          The ESMF_State to add items read from file. Currently only
          Arrays are supported.

   fileName
          File to be read.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors. Equals
          ESMF_RC_LIB_NOT_PRESENT if the NetCDF library is not present.
