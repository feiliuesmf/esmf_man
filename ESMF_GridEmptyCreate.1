  31.6.35 ESMF_GridEmptyCreate - Create a Grid that has no contents

   INTERFACE:
      function ESMF_GridEmptyCreate(vm, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
      type(ESMF_Grid) :: ESMF_GridEmptyCreate

   ARGUMENTS:
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
        type(ESMF_VM),           intent(in),  optional :: vm
        integer,                 intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        7.1.0r
                Added argument vm to support object creation on a
                different VM than that of the current context.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Partially create an ESMF_Grid object. This function allocates an
   ESMF_Grid object, but doesn't allocate any coordinate storage or other
   internal structures. The ESMF_GridEmptyComplete() calls can be used to
   set the values in the grid object and to construct the internal
   structure.

   The arguments are:

   [vm]
          If present, the Grid object is created on the specified ESMF_VM
          object. The default is to create on the VM of the current
          context.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
