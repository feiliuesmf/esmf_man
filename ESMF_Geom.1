35.1 Description

   The ESMF Geom class is used as a container for other ESMF geometry
   objects (e.g. an ESMF Grid). This allows a generic representation of a
   geometry to be passed around (e.g. through a coupled system) without
   it's specific type being known. Some operations are supported on a Geom
   object and more will be added over time as needed. However, if an
   unsupported operation is needed, then the specific geometry object can
   always be pulled out and operated on that way.

   In addition to the geometry object, a Geom can also contain information
   describing a location on a geometry. For example, in the case of a
   Grid, a geometry object will also contain a stagger location. Having
   this location information allows the creation of Fields and other
   capabilities to be performed in the most generic way on a Geom object.
   For geometries where it is appropriate, the user can optionally specify
   this location information during the creation of a Geom object.
   However, if no location is specified, then default values for this
   information are provided which match those which would be used when
   creating a Field with the specific geometry (e.g. stagger location
   ESMF_STAGGERLOC_CENTER for a Grid).
