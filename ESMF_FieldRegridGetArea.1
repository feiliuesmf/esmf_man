  26.6.69 ESMF_FieldRegridGetArea - Get the area of the cells used for
  conservative interpolation

   INTERFACE:
       subroutine ESMF_FieldRegridGetArea(areaField, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_Field), intent(inout)                 :: areaField
       integer, intent(out), optional                  :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   This subroutine gets the area of the cells used for conservative
   interpolation for the grid object associated with areaField and puts
   them into areaField. If created on a 2D Grid, it must be built on the
   ESMF_STAGGERLOC_CENTER stagger location. If created on a 3D Grid, it
   must be built on the ESMF_STAGGERLOC_CENTER_VCENTER stagger location.
   If created on a Mesh, it must be built on the ESMF_MESHLOC_ELEMENT mesh
   location.

   If the user has set the area in the Grid, Mesh, or XGrid under
   areaField, then that's the area that's returned in the units that the
   user set it in. If the user hasn't set the area, then the area is
   calculated and returned. If the Grid, Mesh, or XGrid is on the surface
   of a sphere, then the calculated area is in units of square radians. If
   the Grid, Mesh, or XGrid is Cartesian, then the calculated area is in
   square units of whatever unit the coordinates are in.

   The arguments are:

   areaField
          The Field to put the area values in.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
