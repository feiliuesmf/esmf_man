  51.6.21 ESMF_VMGetCurrent - Get Current VM

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_VMGetCurrent(vm, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_VM), intent(out)           :: vm
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,       intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Get the ESMF_VM object of the current execution context. Calling
   ESMF_VMGetCurrent() within an ESMF Component, will return the same VM
   object as ESMF_GridCompGet(..., vm=vm, ...) or ESMF_CplCompGet(...,
   vm=vm, ...).

   The main purpose of providing ESMF_VMGetCurrent() is to simplify ESMF
   adoption in legacy code. Specifically, code that uses MPI_COMM_WORLD
   deep within its calling tree can easily be modified to use the correct
   MPI communicator of the current ESMF execution context. The advantage
   is that these modifications are very local, and do not require wide
   reaching interface changes in the legacy code to pass down the ESMF
   component object, or the MPI communicator.

   The use of ESMF_VMGetCurrent() is strongly discouraged in newly written
   Component code. Instead, the ESMF Component object should be used as
   the appropriate container of ESMF context information. This object
   should be passed between the subroutines of a Component, and be queried
   for any Component specific information.

   Outside of a Component context, i.e. within the driver context, the
   call to ESMF_VMGetCurrent() is identical to ESMF_VMGetGlobal().

   The arguments are:

   vm
          Upon return this holds the ESMF_VM object of the current
          execution context.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
