  28.6.1 ESMF_DynamicMaskSetR8R8R8 - Set DynamicMask for R8R8R8

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_DynamicMaskSetR8R8R8(dynamicMask, dynamicMaskRoutine, &
     handleAllElements, dynamicSrcMaskValue, &
     dynamicDstMaskValue, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_DynamicMask), intent(out)           :: dynamicMask
     procedure(ESMF_DynamicMaskRoutineR8R8R8)      :: dynamicMaskRoutine
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical,                intent(in),  optional :: handleAllElements
     real(ESMF_KIND_R8),     intent(in),  optional :: dynamicSrcMaskValue
     real(ESMF_KIND_R8),     intent(in),  optional :: dynamicDstMaskValue
     integer,                intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Set an ESMF_DynamicMask object suitable for destination element
   typekind ESMF_TYPEKIND_R8, factor typekind ESMF_TYPEKIND_R8, and source
   element typekind ESMF_TYPEKIND_R8.

   All values in dynamicMask will be reset by this call.

   See section [1170]37.2.6 for a general discussion of dynamic masking.

   The arguments are:

   dynamicMask
          DynamicMask object.

   dynamicMaskRoutine
          The routine responsible for handling dynamically masked source
          and destination elements. See section [1171]37.2.6 for the
          precise definition of the dynamicMaskRoutine procedure
          interface. The routine is only called on PETs where at least one
          interpolation element is identified for special handling.

   [handleAllElements]
          If set to .true., all local elements, regardless of their
          dynamic masking status, are made available to dynamicMaskRoutine
          for handling. This option can be used to implement fully
          customized interpolations based on the information provided by
          ESMF. The default is .false., meaning that only elements
          affected by dynamic masking will be handed to
          dynamicMaskRoutine.

   [dynamicSrcMaskValue]
          The value for which a source element is considered dynamically
          masked. The default is to not consider any source elements as
          dynamically masked.

   [dynamicDstMaskValue]
          The value for which a destination element is considered
          dynamically masked. The default is to not consider any
          destination elements as dynamically masked.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
