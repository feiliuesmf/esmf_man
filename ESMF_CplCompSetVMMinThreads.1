   DESCRIPTION:

   Set characteristics of the ESMF_VM for this ESMF_CplComp. Reduces the
   number of threaded PETs in each VAS. The max argument may be specified
   to limit the maximum number of PEs that a single PET can be associated
   with.

   Several constraints apply: 1) the number of PEs cannot change, 2) PEs
   cannot migrate between single system images (SSIs), 3) the number of
   PETs cannot increase, only decrease, 4) PETs cannot migrate between
   virtual address spaces (VASs), nor can VASs migrate between SSIs.

   The typical use of ESMF_CplCompSetVMMinThreads() is to run a Component
   across a set of single-threaded PETs.

   The arguments are:

   cplcomp
          ESMF_CplComp to set the ESMF_VM for.

   [maxPeCountPerPet]
          Maximum number of PEs on each PET. Default for each SSI is the
          local number of PEs.

   [prefIntraProcess]
          Communication preference within a single process. Currently
          options not documented. Use default.

   [prefIntraSsi]
          Communication preference within a single system image (SSI).
          Currently options not documented. Use default.

   [prefInterSsi]
          Communication preference between different single system images
          (SSIs). Currently options not documented. Use default.

   [pthreadMinStackSize]
          Minimum stack size in byte of any child PET executing as
          Pthread. By default single threaded child PETs do not execute as
          Pthread, and their stack size is unaffected by this argument.
          However, for multi-threaded child PETs, or if forceChildPthreads
          is .true., child PETs execute as Pthreads with their own private
          stack.

          For cases where OpenMP threads are used by the user code, each
          thread allocates its own private stack. For all threads other
          than the master, the stack size is set via the typical
          OMP_STACKSIZE environment variable mechanism. The PET itself,
          however, becomes the master of the OpenMP thread team, and is
          not affected by OMP_STACKSIZE. It is the master's stack that can
          be sized via the pthreadMinStackSize argument, and a large
          enough size is often critical.

          When pthreadMinStackSize is absent, the default is to use the
          system default set by the limit or ulimit command. However, the
          stack of a Pthread cannot be unlimited, and a shell stacksize
          setting of unlimited, or any setting below the ESMF implemented
          minimum, will result in setting the stack size to 20MiB (the
          ESMF minimum). Depending on how much private data is used by the
          user code under the master thread, the default might be too
          small, and pthreadMinStackSize must be used to allocate
          sufficient stack space.

   [forceChildPthreads]
          For .true., force each child PET to execute in its own Pthread.
          By default, .false., single PETs spawned from a parent PET
          execute in the same thread (or MPI process) as the parent PET.
          Multiple child PETs spawned by the same parent PET always
          execute as their own Pthreads.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
