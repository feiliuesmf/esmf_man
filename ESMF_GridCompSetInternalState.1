  17.4.18 ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState - Set private data block pointer

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState(gridcomp, wrappedDataPointer, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_GridComp)             :: gridcomp
     type(wrapper)                   :: wrappedDataPointer
     integer,            intent(out) :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Available to be called by an ESMF_GridComp at any time, but expected to
   be most useful when called during the registration process, or
   initialization. Since init, run, and finalize must be separate
   subroutines, data that they need to share in common can either be
   module global data, or can be allocated in a private data block and the
   address of that block can be registered with the framework and
   retrieved by subsequent calls. When running multiple instantiations of
   an ESMF_GridComp, for example during ensemble runs, it may be simpler
   to maintain private data specific to each run with private data blocks.
   A corresponding ESMF_GridCompGetInternalState call retrieves the data
   pointer.

   Only the last data block set via ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState will be
   accessible.

   CAUTION: If you are working with a compiler that does not support
   Fortran 2018 assumed-type dummy arguments, then this method does not
   have an explicit Fortran interface. In this case do not specify
   argument keywords when calling this method!

   The arguments are:

   gridcomp
          An ESMF_GridComp object.

   wrappedDataPointer
          A pointer to the private data block, wrapped in a derived type
          which contains only a pointer to the block. This level of
          indirection is needed to reliably set and retrieve the data
          block no matter which architecture or compiler is used.

   rc
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors. Note:
          unlike most other ESMF routines, this argument is not optional
          because of implementation considerations.
