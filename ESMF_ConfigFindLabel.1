  47.3.7 ESMF_ConfigFindLabel - Find a label in a Config object

   INTERFACE:
     subroutine ESMF_ConfigFindLabel(config, label, isPresent, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_Config), intent(inout)           :: config
       character(len=*),  intent(in)              :: label
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
       logical,           intent(out),  optional  :: isPresent
       integer,           intent(out),  optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        6.1.0
                Added the isPresent argument. Allows detection of
                end-of-line condition to be separate from the rc.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Finds the label (key) string in the config object starting from the
   beginning of its content.

   Since the search is done by looking for a string, possibly
   multi-worded, in the whole Config object, it is important to use
   special conventions to distinguish labels from other words. This is
   done in the Resource File by using the NASA/DAO convention to finish
   line labels with a colon (:) and table labels with a double colon (::).

   The arguments are:

   config
          Already created ESMF_Config object.

   label
          Identifying label.

   [isPresent]
          Set to .true. if the item is found.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors. If the
          label is not found, and the isPresent argument is not present,
          an error is returned.
