  33.4.18 ESMF_MeshGetMOAB - Check on status of using MOAB library internally.

   INTERFACE:
    subroutine ESMF_MeshGetMOAB(moabOn, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     logical, intent(out)                      :: moabOn
     integer, intent(out), optional            :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   This method is only temporary. It was created to enable testing during
   the stage in ESMF development while we have two internal mesh
   implementations. At some point it will be removed.

   This method can be used to check whether the MOAB library is being used
   to hold the internal structure of the Mesh. When set to .true. the
   following Mesh create calls create a Mesh using MOAB internally. When
   set to .false. the following Mesh create calls use the ESMF native
   internal mesh respresentation. Note that ESMF Meshes created on MOAB
   are only supported in a limited set of operations and should be used
   with caution as they haven't yet been tested as thoroughly as the
   native version. Also, operations that use a pair of Meshes (e.g. regrid
   weight generation) are only supported between meshes of the same type
   (e.g. you can regrid between two MOAB meshes, but not between a MOAB
   and a native mesh).

   moabOn
          Output variable which indicates current state of MOAB.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
