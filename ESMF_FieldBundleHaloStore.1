  25.5.16 ESMF_FieldBundleHaloStore - Precompute a FieldBundle halo operation

   INTERFACE:
     subroutine ESMF_FieldBundleHaloStore(fieldbundle, routehandle, &
       rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(inout) :: fieldbundle
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(inout) :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Store a FieldBundle halo operation over the data in fieldbundle. By
   definition, all elements in the total Field regions that lie outside
   the exclusive regions will be considered potential destination elements
   for the halo operation. However, only those elements that have a
   corresponding halo source element, i.e. an exclusive element on one of
   the DEs, will be updated under the halo operation. Elements that have
   no associated source remain unchanged under halo.

   The routine returns an ESMF_RouteHandle that can be used to call
   ESMF_FieldBundleHalo() on any pair of FieldBundles that matches
   srcFieldBundle and dstFieldBundle in type, kind, and memory layout of
   the gridded dimensions. However, the size, number, and index order of
   ungridded dimensions may be different. See section [738]37.2.5 for a
   more detailed discussion of RouteHandle reusability.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   fieldbundle
          ESMF_FieldBundle containing data to be haloed. The data in this
          FieldBundle may be destroyed by this call.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
