   INTERFACE:

     importState, exportState, clock, syncflag, port, timeout, timeoutFlag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_CplComp),   intent(inout)           :: cplcomp
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_State),     intent(inout), optional :: importState
     type(ESMF_State),     intent(inout), optional :: exportState
     type(ESMF_Clock),     intent(inout), optional :: clock
     type(ESMF_Sync_Flag), intent(in),    optional :: syncflag
     integer,              intent(in),    optional :: port
     integer,              intent(in),    optional :: timeout
     logical,              intent(out),   optional :: timeoutFlag
     integer,              intent(out),   optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Call the ServiceLoop routine for an ESMF_CplComp. This tries to
   establish a "component tunnel" between the actual Component (calling
   this routine) and a dual Component connecting to it through a matching
   SetServices call.

   The arguments are:

   cplcomp
          ESMF_CplComp to call service loop routine for.

   [importState]
          ESMF_State containing import data for coupling. If not present,
          a dummy argument will be passed to the user-supplied routine.
          The importState argument in the user code cannot be optional.

   [exportState]
          ESMF_State containing export data for coupling. If not present,
          a dummy argument will be passed to the user-supplied routine.
          The exportState argument in the user code cannot be optional.

   [clock]
          External ESMF_Clock for passing in time information. This is
          generally the parent component's clock, and will be treated as
          read-only by the child component. The child component can
          maintain a private clock for its own internal time computations.
          If not present, a dummy argument will be passed to the
          user-supplied routine. The clock argument in the user code
          cannot be optional.

   [syncflag]
          Blocking behavior of this method call. See section [289]54.57
          for a list of valid blocking options. Default option is
          ESMF_SYNC_VASBLOCKING which blocks PETs and their spawned off
          threads across each VAS but does not synchronize PETs that run
          in different VASs.

   [port]
          In case a port number is provided, the "component tunnel" is
          established using sockets. The actual component side, i.e. the
          side that calls into ESMF_CplCompServiceLoop(), starts to listen
          on the specified port as the server. The valid port range is
          [1024, 65535]. In case the port argument is not specified, the
          "component tunnel" is established within the same executable
          using local communication methods (e.g. MPI).

   [timeout]
          The maximum period in seconds that this call will wait for
          communications with the dual component, before returning with a
          timeout condition. The default is 3600, i.e. 1 hour. (NOTE:
          Currently this option is only available for socket based
          component tunnels.)

   [timeoutFlag]
          Returns .true. if the timeout was reached, .false. otherwise. If
          timeoutFlag was not provided, a timeout condition will lead to a
          return code of rc \= ESMF_SUCCESS. Otherwise the return value of
          timeoutFlag is the sole indicator of a timeout condition.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
