  17.4.29 ESMF_GridCompWait - Wait for a GridComp to return

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_GridCompWait(gridcomp, syncflag, &
     timeout, timeoutFlag, userRc, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_GridComp),  intent(inout)         :: gridcomp
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_Sync_Flag), intent(in),  optional :: syncflag
     integer,              intent(in),  optional :: timeout
     logical,              intent(out), optional :: timeoutFlag
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        5.3.0
                Added argument timeout. Added argument timeoutFlag. The
                new arguments provide access to the fault-tolerant
                component features.

   DESCRIPTION:

   When executing asynchronously, wait for an ESMF_GridComp to return.

   The arguments are:

   gridcomp
          ESMF_GridComp to wait for.

   [syncflag]
          Blocking behavior of this method call. See section [278]54.57
          for a list of valid blocking options. Default option is
          ESMF_SYNC_VASBLOCKING which blocks PETs and their spawned off
          threads across each VAS but does not synchronize PETs that run
          in different VASs.

   [timeout]
          The maximum period in seconds the actual component is allowed to
          execute a previously invoked component method before it must
          communicate back to the dual component. If the actual component
          does not communicate back in the specified time, a timeout
          condition is raised on the dual side (this side). The default is
          3600, i.e. 1 hour. The timeout argument is only supported for
          connected dual components.

   [timeoutFlag]
          Returns .true. if the timeout was reached, .false. otherwise. If
          timeoutFlag was not provided, a timeout condition will lead to a
          return code of rc \= ESMF_SUCCESS. Otherwise the return value of
          timeoutFlag is the sole indicator of a timeout condition.

   [userRc]
          Return code set by userRoutine before returning.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
