  27.5.19 ESMF_ArrayBundleRedistStore - Precompute an ArrayBundle redistribution
  with local factor argument

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_ArrayBundleRedistStore()
   subroutine ESMF_ArrayBundleRedistStore<type><kind>(srcArrayBundle, &
     dstArrayBundle, routehandle, factor, ignoreUnmatchedIndicesFlag, &

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        8.1.0
                Added argument ignoreUnmatchedIndicesFlag to support cases
                where source and destination side do not cover the exact
                same index space.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Store an ArrayBundle redistribution operation from srcArrayBundle to
   dstArrayBundle. The redistribution between ArrayBundles is defined as
   the sequence of individual Array redistributions over all source and
   destination Array pairs in sequence. The method requires that
   srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle reference an identical number of
   ESMF_Array objects.

   The effect of this method on ArrayBundles that contain aliased members
   is undefined.

   PETs that specify a factor argument must use the <type><kind>
   overloaded interface. Other PETs call into the interface without factor
   argument. If multiple PETs specify the factor argument its type and
   kind as well as its value must match across all PETs. If none of the
   PETs specifies a factor argument the default will be a factor of 1.

   See the description of method ESMF_ArrayRedistStore() for the
   definition of the Array based operation.

   The routine returns an ESMF_RouteHandle that can be used to call
   ESMF_ArrayBundleRedist() on any pair of ArrayBundles that matches
   srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle in type, kind, and memory layout of
   the distributed dimensions. However, the size, number, and index order
   of undistributed dimensions may be different. See section [1046]37.2.5
   for a more detailed discussion of RouteHandle reusability.

   This method is overloaded for:
   ESMF_TYPEKIND_I4, ESMF_TYPEKIND_I8,
   ESMF_TYPEKIND_R4, ESMF_TYPEKIND_R8.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   srcArrayBundle
          ESMF_ArrayBundle with source data.

   dstArrayBundle
          ESMF_ArrayBundle with destination data. The data in these Arrays
          may be destroyed by this call.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   factor
          Factor by which to multiply source data.

   [ignoreUnmatchedIndicesFlag]
          If set to .false., the default, source and destination side must
          cover the identical index space, using precisely matching
          sequence indices. If set to .true., mismatching sequence indices
          between source and destination side are silently ignored. The
          size of this array argument must either be 1 or equal the number
          of Arrays in the srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle arguments. In
          the latter case, the handling of unmatched indices is specified
          for each Array pair separately. If only one element is
          specified, it is used for all Array pairs.

   [srcToDstTransposeMap]
          List with as many entries as there are dimensions in the Arrays
          in srcArrayBundle. Each entry maps the corresponding source
          Array dimension against the specified destination Array
          dimension. Mixing of distributed and undistributed dimensions is
          supported.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
