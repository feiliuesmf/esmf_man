   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        7.0.0
                Added argument termorderflag. The new argument gives the
                user control over the order in which the src terms are
                summed up.

        8.1.0
                Added argument zeroregionflag, and deprecated zeroregion.
                The new argument allows greater flexibility in setting the
                zero region for individual ArrayBundle members.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed ArrayBundle sparse matrix multiplication from the
   Arrays in srcArrayBundle to the Arrays in dstArrayBundle.

   The srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle arguments are optional in support
   of the situation where srcArrayBundle and/or dstArrayBundle are not
   defined on all PETs. The srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle must be
   specified on those PETs that hold source or destination DEs,
   respectively, but may be omitted on all other PETs. PETs that hold
   neither source nor destination DEs may omit both arguments.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   [srcArrayBundle]
          ESMF_ArrayBundle with source data.

   [dstArrayBundle]
          ESMF_ArrayBundle with destination data.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [zeroregion]
          If set to ESMF_REGION_TOTAL (default) the total regions of all
          DEs in all Arrays in dstArrayBundle will be initialized to zero
          before updating the elements with the results of the sparse
          matrix multiplication. If set to ESMF_REGION_EMPTY the elements
          in the Arrays in dstArrayBundle will not be modified prior to
          the sparse matrix multiplication and results will be added to
          the incoming element values. Setting zeroregion to
          ESMF_REGION_SELECT will only zero out those elements in the
          destination Arrays that will be updated by the sparse matrix
          multiplication. See section [1048]54.48 for a complete list of
          valid settings.

   [zeroregionflag]
          If set to ESMF_REGION_TOTAL (default) the total regions of all
          DEs in the destination Array will be initialized to zero before
          updating the elements with the results of the sparse matrix
          multiplication. If set to ESMF_REGION_EMPTY the elements in the
          destination Array will not be modified prior to the sparse
          matrix multiplication and results will be added to the incoming
          element values. A setting of ESMF_REGION_SELECT will only zero
          out those elements in the destination Array that will be updated
          by the sparse matrix multiplication. See section [1049]54.48 for
          a complete list of valid settings. The size of this array
          argument must either be 1 or equal the number of Arrays in the
          srcArrayBundle and dstArrayBundle arguments. In the latter case,
          the zero region for each Array SMM operation is indicated
          separately. If only one zero region element is specified, it is
          used for all Array pairs.

   [termorderflag]
          Specifies the order of the source side terms in all of the
          destination sums. The termorderflag only affects the order of
          terms during the execution of the RouteHandle. See the
          [1050]37.2.1 section for an in-depth discussion of all
          bit-for-bit reproducibility aspects related to route-based
          communication methods. See [1051]54.58 for a full list of
          options. The size of this array argument must either be 1 or
          equal the number of Arrays in the srcArrayBundle and
          dstArrayBundle arguments. In the latter case, the term order for
          each Array SMM operation is indicated separately. If only one
          term order element is specified, it is used for all Array pairs.
          The default is (/ESMF_TERMORDER_FREE/), allowing maximum
          flexibility in the order of terms for optimum performance.

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input Array pairs will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
