   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        7.1.0r
                Added arguments gridList, mesh, meshList, locstream,
                locstreamList, xgrid, and xgridList. These arguments add
                support for holding references to multiple geom objects,
                either of the same type, or different type, in the same
                ESMF_GridComp object.

   DESCRIPTION:

   This interface creates an ESMF_GridComp object. By default, a separate
   VM context will be created for each component. This implies creating a
   new MPI communicator and allocating additional memory to manage the VM
   resources. When running on a large number of processors, creating a
   separate VM for each component could be both time and memory
   inefficient. If the application is sequential, i.e., each component is
   running on all the PETs of the global VM, it will be more efficient to
   use the global VM instead of creating a new one. This can be done by
   setting contextflag to ESMF_CONTEXT_PARENT_VM.

   The return value is the new ESMF_GridComp.

   The arguments are:

   [grid]
          Associate an ESMF_Grid object with the newly created component.
          This is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF
          library code does not access the grid object. The grid argument
          is mutually exclusive with the gridList argument. If both
          arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an error is
          returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither grid nor gridList
          are provided, no ESMF_Grid objects are associated with the
          component.

   [gridList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_Grid objects with the newly created
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the gridList object. The
          gridList argument is mutually exclusive with the grid argument.
          If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an
          error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither grid nor
          gridList are provided, no ESMF_Grid objects are associated with
          the component.

   [mesh]
          Associate an ESMF_Mesh object with the newly created component.
          This is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF
          library code does not access the mesh object. The mesh argument
          is mutually exclusive with the meshList argument. If both
          arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an error is
          returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither mesh nor meshList
          are provided, no ESMF_Mesh objects are associated with the
          component.

   [meshList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_Mesh objects with the newly created
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the meshList object. The
          meshList argument is mutually exclusive with the mesh argument.
          If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an
          error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither mesh nor
          meshList are provided, no ESMF_Mesh objects are associated with
          the component.

   [locstream]
          Associate an ESMF_LocStream object with the newly created
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the locstream object. The
          locstream argument is mutually exclusive with the locstreamList
          argument. If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail,
          and an error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither
          locstream nor locstreamList are provided, no ESMF_LocStream
          objects are associated with the component.

   [locstreamList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_LocStream objects with the newly
          created component. This is simply a convenience feature for the
          user. The ESMF library code does not access the locstreamList
          object. The locstreamList argument is mutually exclusive with
          the locstream argument. If both arguments are provided, the
          routine will fail, and an error is returned in rc. By default,
          i.e. if neither locstream nor locstreamList are provided, no
          ESMF_LocStream objects are associated with the component.

   [xgrid]
          Associate an ESMF_XGrid object with the newly created component.
          This is simply a convenience feature for the user. The ESMF
          library code does not access the xgrid object. The xgrid
          argument is mutually exclusive with the xgridList argument. If
          both arguments are provided, the routine will fail, and an error
          is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither xgrid nor
          xgridList are provided, no ESMF_XGrid objects are associated
          with the component.

   [xgridList]
          Associate a list of ESMF_XGrid objects with the newly created
          component. This is simply a convenience feature for the user.
          The ESMF library code does not access the xgridList object. The
          xgridList argument is mutually exclusive with the xgrid
          argument. If both arguments are provided, the routine will fail,
          and an error is returned in rc. By default, i.e. if neither
          xgrid nor xgridList are provided, no ESMF_XGrid objects are
          associated with the component.

   [config]
          An already-created ESMF_Config object to be attached to the
          newly created component. If both config and configFile arguments
          are specified, config takes priority.

   [configFile]
          The filename of an ESMF_Config format file. If specified, a new
          ESMF_Config object is created and attached to the newly created
          component. The configFile file is opened and associated with the
          new config object. If both config and configFile arguments are
          specified, config takes priority.

   [clock]
          Component-specific ESMF_Clock. This clock is available to be
          queried and updated by the new ESMF_GridComp as it chooses. This
          should not be the parent component clock, which should be
          maintained and passed down to the initialize/run/finalize
          routines separately.

   [petList]
          List of parent PETs given to the created child component by the
          parent component. If petList is not specified, or is empty, all
          of the parent PETs are given to the child component. The order
          of PETs in petList determines how the child local PETs map back
          to the parent PETs.

   [contextflag]
          Specify the component's VM context. The default context is
          ESMF_CONTEXT_OWN_VM. See section [263]54.10 for a complete list
          of valid flags.

   [name]
          Name of the newly-created ESMF_GridComp. This name can be
          altered from within the ESMF_GridComp code once the
          initialization routine is called.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
