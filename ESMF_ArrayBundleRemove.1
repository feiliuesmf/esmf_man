   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_ArrayBundle), intent(inout)         :: arraybundle
     character(len=*),       intent(in)            :: arrayNameList(:)
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical,                intent(in),  optional :: multiflag

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting

       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Remove Array(s) by name from ArrayBundle. In the relaxed setting it is
   not an error if arrayNameList contains names that are not found in
   arraybundle.

   arraybundle
          ESMF_ArrayBundle from which to remove items.

   arrayNameList
          List of items to remove.

   [multiflag]
          A setting of .true. allows multiple Arrays with the same name to
          be removed from arraybundle. For .false., items to be removed
          must have unique names. The default setting is .false..

   [relaxedflag]
          A setting of .true. indicates a relaxed definition of "remove"
          where it is not an error if arrayNameList contains item names
          that are not found in arraybundle. For .false. this is treated
          as an error condition. Further, in multiflag=.false. mode, the
          relaxed definition of "remove" also covers the case where there
          are multiple items in arraybundle that match a single entry in
          arrayNameList. For relaxedflag=.false. this is treated as an
          error condition. The default setting is .false..

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
