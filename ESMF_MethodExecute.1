  22.4.13 ESMF_MethodExecute - Execute user method attached to CplComp

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_MethodExecute()
   recursive subroutine ESMF_MethodCplCompExecute(cplcomp, label, index, existfl
ag, &
     userRc, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_CplComp)                      :: cplcomp
     character(len=*), intent(in)            :: label
     integer,          intent(in),  optional :: index
     logical,          intent(out), optional :: existflag
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute attached method.

   The arguments are:

   cplcomp
          The ESMF_CplComp object holding the attachable method.

   label
          Label of method.

   [index]
          Integer modifier to distinguish multiple entries with the same
          label.

   [existflag]
          Returned .true. indicates that the method specified by label
          exists and was executed. A return value of .false. indicates
          that the method does not exist and consequently was not
          executed. By default, i.e. if existflag was not specified, the
          latter condition will lead to rc not equal ESMF_SUCCESS being
          returned. However, if existflag was specified, a method not
          existing is not an error condition.

   [userRc]
          Return code set by attached method before returning.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.

  22.4.14 ESMF_MethodExecute - Execute user method attached to GridComp

   INTERFACE:

     integer,          intent(in),  optional :: index
     logical,          intent(out), optional :: existflag
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   [index]
          Integer modifier to distinguish multiple entries with the same
          label.

   [existflag]
          Returned .true. indicates that the method specified by label
          exists and was executed. A return value of .false. indicates
          that the method does not exist and consequently was not
          executed. By default, i.e. if existflag was not specified, the

  22.4.15 ESMF_MethodExecute - Execute user method attached to State

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_MethodExecute()
   recursive subroutine ESMF_MethodStateExecute(state, label, index, existflag,
&
     userRc, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_State)                        :: state
     character(len=*), intent(in)            :: label
     integer,          intent(in),  optional :: index
     logical,          intent(out), optional :: existflag
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,          intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute attached method.

   The arguments are:

   state
          The ESMF_State object holding the attachable method.

   label
          Label of method.

   [index]
          Integer modifier to distinguish multiple entries with the same
          label.

   [existflag]
          Returned .true. indicates that the method specified by label
          exists and was executed. A return value of .false. indicates
