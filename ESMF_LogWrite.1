  49.7.15 ESMF_LogWrite - Write to Log file(s)

   INTERFACE:
       recursive subroutine ESMF_LogWrite(msg, logmsgFlag, &
                         logmsgList,      & ! DEPRECATED ARGUMENT
                         line, file, method, log, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       character(len=*),      intent(in)             :: msg
       type(ESMF_LogMsg_Flag),intent(in),optional    :: logmsgFlag
       type(ESMF_LogMsg_Flag),intent(in),optional::logmsgList ! DEPRECATED ARG
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
       integer,               intent(in),   optional :: line
       character(len=*),      intent(in),   optional :: file
       character(len=*),      intent(in),   optional :: method
       type(ESMF_Log),        intent(inout),optional :: log
       integer,               intent(out),  optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        5.2.0rp1
                Added argument logmsgFlag. Started to deprecate argument
                logmsgList. This corrects inconsistent use of the List
                suffix on the argument name. In ESMF this suffix indicates
                one-dimensional array arguments.

   DESCRIPTION:

   This subroutine writes to the file associated with an ESMF_Log. A
   message is passed in along with the logmsgFlag, line, file and method.
   If the write to the ESMF_Log is successful, the function will return a
   logical true. This function is the base function used by all the other
   ESMF_Log writing methods.

   The arguments are:

   msg
          User-provided message string.

   [logmsgFlag]
          The type of message. See Section [598]49.2.3 for possible
          values. If not specified, the default is ESMF_LOGMSG_INFO.

   [logmsgList]
          DEPRECATED ARGUMENT! Please use the argument logmsgFlag instead.

   [line]
          Integer source line number. Expected to be set by using the
          preprocessor macro __LINE__ macro.

   [file]
          User-provided source file name.

   [method]
          User-provided method string.

   [log]
          An optional ESMF_Log object that can be used instead of the
          default Log.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
