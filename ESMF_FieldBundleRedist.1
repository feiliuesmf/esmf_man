  25.5.20 ESMF_FieldBundleRedist - Execute a FieldBundle redistribution

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldBundleRedist(srcFieldBundle, dstFieldBundle, &
     routehandle, checkflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
         type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(in), optional :: srcFieldBundle
         type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(inout), optional :: dstFieldBundle
         type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(inout) :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
         logical, intent(in), optional :: checkflag
         integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed redistribution from srcFieldBundle to
   dstFieldBundle. Both srcFieldBundle and dstFieldBundle must match the
   respective FieldBundles used during ESMF_FieldBundleRedistStore() in
   type, kind, and memory layout of the gridded dimensions. However, the
   size, number, and index order of ungridded dimensions may be different.
   See section [741]37.2.5 for a more detailed discussion of RouteHandle
   reusability.

   The srcFieldBundle and dstFieldBundle arguments are optional in support
   of the situation where srcFieldBundle and/or dstFieldBundle are not
   defined on all PETs. The srcFieldBundle and dstFieldBundle must be
   specified on those PETs that hold source or destination DEs,
   respectively, but may be omitted on all other PETs. PETs that hold
   neither source nor destination DEs may omit both arguments.

   It is erroneous to specify the identical FieldBundle object for
   srcFieldBundle and dstFieldBundle arguments.

   See ESMF_FieldBundleRedistStore() on how to precompute routehandle.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   For examples and associated documentation regarding this method see
   Section [742]25.2.9.

   [srcFieldBundle]
          ESMF_FieldBundle with source data.

   [dstFieldBundle]
          ESMF_FieldBundle with destination data.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input FieldBundle pair will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
