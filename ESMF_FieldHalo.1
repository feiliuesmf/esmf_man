  26.6.55 ESMF_FieldHalo - Execute a FieldHalo operation

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldHalo(field, routehandle,  &
                             routesyncflag, finishedflag, checkflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Field),          intent(inout)          :: field
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle),    intent(inout)          :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_RouteSync_Flag), intent(in),  optional  :: routesyncflag
     logical,                   intent(out), optional  :: finishedflag
     logical,                   intent(in),  optional  :: checkflag
     integer,                   intent(out), optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed Field halo operation for field. The field
   argument must match the Field used during ESMF_FieldHaloStore() in
   type, kind, and memory layout of the gridded dimensions. However, the
   size, number, and index order of ungridded dimensions may be different.
   See section [957]37.2.5 for a more detailed discussion of RouteHandle
   reusability.

   See ESMF_FieldHaloStore() on how to precompute routehandle.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   field
          ESMF_Field containing data to be haloed.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [routesyncflag]
          Indicate communication option. Default is
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_BLOCKING, resulting in a blocking operation. See
          section [958]54.51 for a complete list of valid settings.

   [finishedflag]
          Used in combination with routesyncflag =
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBTESTFINISH. Returned finishedflag equal to
          .true. indicates that all operations have finished. A value of
          .false. indicates that there are still unfinished operations
          that require additional calls with routesyncflag =
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBTESTFINISH, or a final call with routesyncflag
          = ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBWAITFINISH. For all other routesyncflag
          settings the returned value in finishedflag is always .true..

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input Field pair will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
