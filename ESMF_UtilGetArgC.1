  53.4.2 ESMF_UtilGetArgC - Return number of command line arguments

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_UtilGetArgC(count, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     integer, intent(out)           :: count
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   This method returns the number of command line arguments specified when
   the process was started.

   The number of arguments returned does not include the name of the
   command itself - which is typically returned as argument zero.

   Some MPI implementations do not consistently provide command line
   arguments on PETs other than PET 0. It is therefore recommended that
   PET 0 call this method and broadcast the results to the other PETs by
   using the ESMF_VMBroadcast() method.

   The arguments are:

   count
          Count of command line arguments.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
