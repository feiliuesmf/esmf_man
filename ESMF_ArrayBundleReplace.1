   INTERFACE:
     subroutine ESMF_ArrayBundleReplace(arraybundle, arrayList, &
       multiflag, relaxedflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_ArrayBundle), intent(inout)         :: arraybundle
     type(ESMF_Array),       intent(in)            :: arrayList(:)
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical,                intent(in),  optional :: multiflag
     logical,                intent(in),  optional :: relaxedflag
     integer,                intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Replace Array(s) by name in ArrayBundle. In the relaxed setting it is
   not an error if arrayList contains Arrays that do not match by name any
   item in arraybundle. These Arrays are simply ignored in this case.

   arraybundle
          ESMF_ArrayBundle in which to replace items.

   arrayList
          List of items to replace.

   [multiflag]
          A setting of .true. allows multiple items with the same name to
          be replaced in arraybundle. For .false., items to be replaced
          must have unique names. The default setting is .false..

   [relaxedflag]
          A setting of .true. indicates a relaxed definition of "replace"
          where it is not an error if arrayList contains items with names
          that are not found in arraybundle. These items in arrayList are
          ignored in the relaxed mode. For .false. this is treated as an
          error condition. Further, in multiflag=.false. mode, the relaxed
          definition of "replace" also covers the case where there are
          multiple items in arraybundle that match a single entry by name
          in arrayList. For relaxedflag=.false. this is treated as an
          error condition. The default setting is .false..

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
