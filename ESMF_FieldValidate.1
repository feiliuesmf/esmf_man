  26.6.81 ESMF_FieldValidate - Check validity of a Field

   INTERFACE:
       subroutine ESMF_FieldValidate(field, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_Field), intent(in)            :: field
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
       integer,          intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Validates that the field is internally consistent. Currently this
   method determines if the field is uninitialized or already destroyed.
   It validates the contained array and grid objects. The code also checks
   if the array and grid sizes agree. This check compares the distgrid
   contained in array and grid; then it proceeds to compare the
   computational bounds contained in array and grid.

   The method returns an error code if problems are found.

   The arguments are:

   field
          ESMF_Field to validate.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if the field is valid.
