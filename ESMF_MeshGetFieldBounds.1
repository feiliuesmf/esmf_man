   DESCRIPTION:

   Compute the lower and upper bounds of Fortran data array that can later
   be used in FieldCreate interface to create a ESMF_Field from a
   ESMF_Mesh and the Fortran data array. For an example and associated
   documentation using this method see section [1037]26.3.9.

   The arguments are:

   mesh
          ESMF_Mesh.

   [meshloc]
          Which part of the mesh to build the Field on. Can be set to
          either ESMF_MESHLOC_NODE or ESMF_MESHLOC_ELEMENT. If not set,
          defaults to ESMF_MESHLOC_NODE.

   [localDe]
          Local DE for which information is requested.
          [0,..,localDeCount-1]. For localDeCount==1 the localDe argument
          may be omitted, in which case it will default to localDe=0.

   [gridToFieldMap]
          List with number of elements equal to the grid|s dimCount. The
          list elements map each dimension of the grid to a dimension in
          the field by specifying the appropriate field dimension index.
          The default is to map all of the grid|s dimensions against the
          lowest dimensions of the field in sequence, i.e. gridToFieldMap
          = (/1,2,3,.../). The values of all gridToFieldMap entries must
          be greater than or equal to one and smaller than or equal to the
          field rank. It is erroneous to specify the same gridToFieldMap
          entry multiple times. The total ungridded dimensions in the
          field are the total field dimensions less the dimensions in the
          grid. Ungridded dimensions must be in the same order they are
          stored in the field.

   [ungriddedLBound]
          Lower bounds of the ungridded dimensions of the field. The
          number of elements in the ungriddedLBound is equal to the number
          of ungridded dimensions in the field. All ungridded dimensions
          of the field are also undistributed. When field dimension count
          is greater than grid dimension count, both ungriddedLBound and
          ungriddedUBound must be specified. When both are specified the
          values are checked for consistency. Note that the the ordering
          of these ungridded dimensions is the same as their order in the
          field.

   [ungriddedUBound]
          Upper bounds of the ungridded dimensions of the field. The
          number of elements in the ungriddedUBound is equal to the number
          of ungridded dimensions in the field. All ungridded dimensions
          of the field are also undistributed. When field dimension count
          is greater than grid dimension count, both ungriddedLBound and
          ungriddedUBound must be specified. When both are specified the
          values are checked for consistency. Note that the the ordering
          of these ungridded dimensions is the same as their order in the
          field.

   [totalLBound]
          The relative lower bounds of Fortran data array to be used later
          in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_Mesh and Fortran data array. This
          is an output variable from this user interface.

   [totalUBound]
          The relative upper bounds of Fortran data array to be used later
          in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_Mesh and Fortran data array. This
          is an output variable from this user interface.

   [totalCount]
          Number of elements need to be allocated for Fortran data array
          to be used later in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_Mesh and Fortran
          data array. This is an output variable from this user interface.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
