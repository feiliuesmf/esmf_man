  28.5.22 ESMF_ArrayHalo - Execute an Array halo operation

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_ArrayHalo(array, routehandle, &
     routesyncflag, finishedflag, cancelledflag, checkflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Array),          intent(inout)         :: array
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle),    intent(inout)         :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_RouteSync_Flag), intent(in),  optional :: routesyncflag
     logical,                   intent(out), optional :: finishedflag
     logical,                   intent(out), optional :: cancelledflag
     logical,                   intent(in),  optional :: checkflag
     integer,                   intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed Array halo operation for array. The array
   argument must match the respective Array used during
   ESMF_ArrayHaloStore() in type, kind, and memory layout of the
   distributed dimensions. However, the size, number, and index order of
   undistributed dimensions may be different. See section [1096]37.2.5 for
   a more detailed discussion of RouteHandle reusability.

   See ESMF_ArrayHaloStore() on how to precompute routehandle.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   array
          ESMF_Array containing data to be haloed.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [routesyncflag]
          Indicate communication option. Default is
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_BLOCKING, resulting in a blocking operation. See
          section [1097]54.51 for a complete list of valid settings.

   [finishedflag]
          Used in combination with routesyncflag =
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBTESTFINISH. Returned finishedflag equal to
          .true. indicates that all operations have finished. A value of
          .false. indicates that there are still unfinished operations
          that require additional calls with routesyncflag =
          ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBTESTFINISH, or a final call with routesyncflag
          = ESMF_ROUTESYNC_NBWAITFINISH. For all other routesyncflag
          settings the returned value in finishedflag is always .true..

   [cancelledflag]
          A value of .true. indicates that were cancelled communication
          operations. In this case the data in the dstArray must be
          considered invalid. It may have been partially modified by the
          call. A value of .false. indicates that none of the
          communication operations was cancelled. The data in dstArray is
          valid if finishedflag returns equal .true..

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input Array pair will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
