  50.6.11 ESMF_DELayoutServiceOffer - Offer service for a DE in DELayout

   INTERFACE:
   recursive function ESMF_DELayoutServiceOffer(delayout, de, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_ServiceReply_Flag) :: ESMF_DELayoutServiceOffer

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_DELayout),  intent(in)            :: delayout
     integer,              intent(in)            :: de
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Offer service for a DE in the ESMF_DELayout object. This call together
   with ESMF_DELayoutServiceComplete() provides the synchronization
   primitives between the PETs of an ESMF multi-threaded VM necessary for
   dynamic load balancing via a work queue approach.

   The calling PET will either receive ESMF_SERVICEREPLY_ACCEPT if the
   service offer has been accepted by DELayout or ESMF_SERVICEREPLY_DENY
   if the service offer was denied. The service offer paradigm is
   different from a simple mutex approach in that the DELayout keeps track
   of the number of service offers issued for each DE by each PET and
   accepts only one PET's offer for each offer increment. This requires
   that all PETs use ESMF_DELayoutServiceOffer() in unison. See section
   [606]50.2.2 for the potential return values.

   The arguments are:

   delayout
          Specified ESMF_DELayout object.

   de
          DE for which service is offered by the calling PET.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
