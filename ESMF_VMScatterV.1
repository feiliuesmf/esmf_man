  51.6.29 ESMF_VMScatterV - ScatterV across VM

   INTERFACE:
    subroutine ESMF_VMScatterV(vm, sendData, sendCounts, &
      sendOffsets, recvData, recvCount, rootPet, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
      type(ESMF_VM),                    intent(in)            :: vm
      <type>(ESMF_KIND_<kind>), target, intent(in)            :: sendData(:)
      integer,                          intent(in)            :: sendCounts(:)
      integer,                          intent(in)            :: sendOffsets(:)
      <type>(ESMF_KIND_<kind>), target, intent(out)           :: recvData(:)
      integer,                          intent(in)            :: recvCount
      integer,                          intent(in)            :: rootPet
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
      integer,                          intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Collective ESMF_VM communication call that scatters contiguous data of
   <type><kind> from rootPet across all the PETs of an ESMF_VM object.
   Every PET, including rootPet, receives a portion of the data. The
   recvCount number of elements received by PET i originate from the
   sendData array on rootPet, starting at position sendOffsets(i). Each
   PET stores the received contiguous data portion at the start of its
   recvData array.

   This method is overloaded for: ESMF_TYPEKIND_I4, ESMF_TYPEKIND_I8,
   ESMF_TYPEKIND_R4, ESMF_TYPEKIND_R8.

   The arguments are:

   vm
          ESMF_VM object.

   sendData
          Contiguous data array holding data to be sent. Only the sendData
          array specified by the rootPet will be used by this method.

   sendCounts
          Number of sendData elements to be sent to corresponding receive
          PET.

   sendOffsets
          Offsets in units of elements in sendData marking the start of
          element sequence to be sent to receive PET.

   recvData
          Contiguous data array for data to be received. All PETs must
          specify a valid recvData argument large enough to accommodate
          the received data.

   recvCount
          Number of recvData elements to receive by local PET from
          rootPet.

   rootPet
          PET that holds data that is being scattered.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
