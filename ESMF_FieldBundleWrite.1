  25.5.39 ESMF_FieldBundleWrite - Write the Fields into a file

   INTERFACE:

       convention, purpose, singleFile, overwrite, status, timeslice, iofmt, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(in) :: fieldbundle
     character(*), intent(in) :: fileName
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     character(*), intent(in), optional :: convention
     character(*), intent(in), optional :: purpose
     logical, intent(in), optional :: singleFile
     logical , intent(in), optional :: overwrite
     type(ESMF_FileStatus_Flag), intent(in), optional :: status
     integer, intent(in), optional :: timeslice
     type(ESMF_IOFmt_Flag), intent(in), optional :: iofmt
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Write the Fields into a file. For this API to be functional, the
   environment variable ESMF_PIO should be set to either "internal" or
   "external" when the ESMF library is built. Please see the section on
   Data I/O, [781]38.2.

   When convention and purpose arguments are specified, NetCDF dimension
   labels and variable attributes are written from each Field in the
   FieldBundle from the corresponding Attribute package. Additionally,
   Attributes may be set on the FieldBundle level under the same Attribute
   package. This allows the specification of global attributes within the
   file. As with individual Fields, the value associated with each name
   may be either a scalar character string, or a scalar or array of type
   integer, real, or double precision.

   Limitations:
     * For multi-tile Fields, all Fields in the FieldBundle must contain
       the same number of tiles.
     * Not supported in ESMF_COMM=mpiuni mode.

   The arguments are:

   fieldbundle
          An ESMF_FieldBundle object.

   fileName
          The name of the output file to which field bundle data is
          written. If the FieldBundle contains multi-tile Arrays, then
          fileName must contain exactly one instance of "*"; this is a
          placeholder that will be replaced by the tile number, with each
          tile being written to a separate file. (For example, for a
          fileName of "myfile*.nc", tile 1 will be written to
          "myfile1.nc", tile 2 to "myfile2.nc", etc.) (This handling of
          the fileName for multi-tile I/O is subject to change.)

   [convention]
          Specifies an Attribute package associated with the FieldBundle,
          and the contained Fields, used to create NetCDF dimension labels
          and attributes in the file. When this argument is present, the
          purpose argument must also be present. Use this argument only
          with a NetCDF I/O format. If binary format is used, ESMF will
          return an error code.

   [purpose]
          Specifies an Attribute package associated with the FieldBundle,
          and the contained Fields, used to create NetCDF dimension labels
          and attributes in the file. When this argument is present, the
          convention argument must also be present. Use this argument only
          with a NetCDF I/O format. If binary format is used, ESMF will
          return an error code.

   [singleFile]
          A logical flag, the default is .true., i.e., all fields in the
          bundle are written in one single file. If .false., each field
          will be written in separate files; these files are numbered with
          the name based on the argument "file". That is, a set of files
          are named: [file_name]001, [file_name]002, [file_name]003,...

   [overwrite]
          A logical flag, the default is .false., i.e., existing field
          data may not be overwritten. If .true., only the data
          corresponding to the fields name will be be overwritten. If the
          timeslice option is given, only data for the given timeslice
          will be overwritten. Note that it is always an error to attempt
          to overwrite a NetCDF variable with data which has a different
          shape.

   [status]
          The file status. Please see Section [782]54.21 for the list of
          options. If not present, defaults to ESMF_FILESTATUS_UNKNOWN.

   [timeslice]
          Some I/O formats (e.g. NetCDF) support the output of data in
          form of time slices. The timeslice argument provides access to
          this capability. timeslice must be positive. The behavior of
          this option may depend on the setting of the overwrite flag:

        overwrite = .false.:
                If the timeslice value is less than the maximum time
                already in the file, the write will fail.

        overwrite = .true.:
                Any positive timeslice value is valid.

          By default, i.e. by omitting the timeslice argument, no
          provisions for time slicing are made in the output file,
          however, if the file already contains a time axis for the
          variable, a timeslice one greater than the maximum will be
          written.

   [iofmt]
          The I/O format. Please see Section [783]54.28 for the list of
          options. If not present, defaults to ESMF_IOFMT_NETCDF.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
