  31.6.52 ESMF_GridMatch - Check if two Grid objects match

   INTERFACE:
   function ESMF_GridMatch(grid1, grid2, globalflag, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_GridMatch_Flag) :: ESMF_GridMatch

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_Grid),  intent(in)              :: grid1
     type(ESMF_Grid),  intent(in)              :: grid2
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical,          intent(in),   optional  :: globalflag
     integer,          intent(out),  optional  :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Check if grid1 and grid2 match. Returns a range of values of type
   ESMF_GridMatch indicating how closely the Grids match. For a
   description of the possible return values, please see [1425]31.2.3.
   Please also note that by default this call is not collective and only
   returns the match for the piece of the Grids on the local PET. In this
   case, it is possible for this call to return a different match on
   different PETs for the same Grids. To do a global match operation set
   the globalflag argument to .true.. In this case, the call becomes
   collective across the current VM, ensuring the same result is returned
   on all PETs.

   The arguments are:

   grid1
          ESMF_Grid object.

   grid2
          ESMF_Grid object.

   [globalflag]
          By default this flag is set to false. When it's set to true, the
          function performs the match check globally. In this case, the
          method becomes collective across the current VM.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
