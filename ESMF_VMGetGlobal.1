  51.6.20 ESMF_VMGetGlobal - Get Global VM

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_VMGetGlobal(vm, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_VM), intent(out)            :: vm
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,       intent(out), optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Get the global ESMF_VM object. This is the VM object that is created
   during ESMF_Initialize() and is the ultimate parent of all VM objects
   in an ESMF application. It is identical to the VM object returned by
   ESMF_Initialize(..., vm=vm, ...).

   The ESMF_VMGetGlobal() call provides access to information about the
   global execution context via the global VM. This call is necessary
   because ESMF does not created a global ESMF Component during
   ESMF_Initialize() that could be queried for information about the
   global execution context of an ESMF application.

   Usage of ESMF_VMGetGlobal() from within Component code is strongly
   discouraged. ESMF Components should only access their own VM objects
   through Component methods. Global information, if required by the
   Component user code, should be passed down to the Component from the
   driver through the Component calling interface.

   The arguments are:

   vm
          Upon return this holds the ESMF_VM object of the global
          execution context.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
