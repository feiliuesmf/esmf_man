  27.5.16 ESMF_ArrayBundleRead - Read Arrays to an ArrayBundle from file(s)

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_ArrayBundleRead(arraybundle, fileName, &
     singleFile, timeslice, iofmt, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_ArrayBundle), intent(inout)          :: arraybundle
     character(*),           intent(in)             :: fileName
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     logical,                intent(in),  optional  :: singleFile
     integer,                intent(in),  optional  :: timeslice
     type(ESMF_IOFmt_Flag),  intent(in),  optional  :: iofmt
     integer,                intent(out), optional  :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Read Array data to an ArrayBundle object from file(s). For this API to
   be functional, the environment variable ESMF_PIO should be set to
   either "internal" or "external" when the ESMF library is built. Please
   see the section on Data I/O, [1044]38.2.

   Limitations:
     * For multi-tile Arrays, all Arrays in the ArrayBundle must contain
       the same number of tiles.
     * Not supported in ESMF_COMM=mpiuni mode.

   The arguments are:

   arraybundle
          An ESMF_ArrayBundle object.

   fileName
          The name of the file from which ArrayBundle data is read. If the
          ArrayBundle contains multi-tile Arrays, then fileName must
          contain exactly one instance of "*"; this is a placeholder that
          will be replaced by the tile number, with each tile being read
          from a separate file. (For example, for a fileName of
          "myfile*.nc", tile 1 will be read from "myfile1.nc", tile 2 from
          "myfile2.nc", etc.) (This handling of the fileName for
          multi-tile I/O is subject to change.)

   [singleFile]
          A logical flag, the default is .true., i.e., all Arrays in the
          bundle are stored in one single file. If .false., each Array is
          stored in separate files; these files are numbered with the name
          based on the argument "file". That is, a set of files are named:
          [file_name]001, [file_name]002, [file_name]003,...

   [timeslice]
          The time-slice number of the variable read from file.

   [iofmt]
          The I/O format. Please see Section [1045]54.28 for the list of
          options. If not present, defaults to ESMF_IOFMT_NETCDF.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
