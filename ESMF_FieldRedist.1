  26.6.61 ESMF_FieldRedist - Execute a Field redistribution

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldRedist(srcField, dstField, routehandle,  &
     checkflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
         type(ESMF_Field),       intent(in),optional     :: srcField
         type(ESMF_Field),       intent(inout),optional  :: dstField
         type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(inout)           :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
         logical,                intent(in),   optional  :: checkflag
         integer,                intent(out),  optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed Field redistribution from srcField to dstField.
   Both srcField and dstField must match the respective Fields used during
   ESMF_FieldRedistStore() in type, kind, and memory layout of the gridded
   dimensions. However, the size, number, and index order of ungridded
   dimensions may be different. See section [963]37.2.5 for a more
   detailed discussion of RouteHandle reusability.

   The srcField and dstField arguments are optional in support of the
   situation where srcField and/or dstField are not defined on all PETs.
   The srcField and dstField must be specified on those PETs that hold
   source or destination DEs, respectively, but may be omitted on all
   other PETs. PETs that hold neither source nor destination DEs may omit
   both arguments.

   It is erroneous to specify the identical Field object for srcField and
   dstField arguments.

   See ESMF_FieldRedistStore() on how to precompute routehandle.

   This call is collective across the current VM.

   For examples and associated documentation regarding this method see
   Section [964]26.3.30.

   [srcField]
          ESMF_Field with source data.

   [dstField]
          ESMF_Field with destination data.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input Field pair will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
