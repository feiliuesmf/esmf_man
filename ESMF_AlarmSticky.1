  46.6.19 ESMF_AlarmSticky - Set an Alarm's sticky flag

   INTERFACE:
       subroutine ESMF_AlarmSticky(alarm, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
       type(ESMF_Alarm), intent(inout)         :: alarm
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
       integer,          intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Set an ESMF_Alarm's sticky flag; once alarm is ringing, it remains
   ringing until ESMF_AlarmRingerOff() is called. There is an implicit
   limitation that in order to properly reverse timestep through a ring
   end time in ESMF_DIRECTION_REVERSE, that time must have already been
   traversed in the forward direction. This is due to the fact that an
   ESMF_Alarm cannot predict when user code will call
   ESMF_AlarmRingerOff(). An error message will be logged when this
   limitation is not satisfied.

   The arguments are:

   alarm
          The object instance to be set sticky.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
