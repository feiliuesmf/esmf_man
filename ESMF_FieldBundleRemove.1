   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldBundleRemove(fieldbundle, fieldNameList, &
     multiflag, relaxedflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(inout) :: fieldbundle
     character(len=*), intent(in) :: fieldNameList(:)
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --

     logical, intent(in), optional :: relaxedflag
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Remove field(s) by name from FieldBundle. In the relaxed setting it is
   not an error if fieldNameList contains names that are not found in
   fieldbundle.

   fieldbundle
          ESMF_FieldBundle from which to remove items.

   fieldNameList
          List of items to remove.

   [multiflag]
          A setting of .true. allows multiple Fields with the same name to
          be removed from fieldbundle. For .false., items to be removed
          must have unique names. The default setting is .false..

   [relaxedflag]
          A setting of .true. indicates a relaxed definition of "remove"
          where it is not an error if fieldNameList contains item names
          that are not found in fieldbundle. For .false. this is treated
          as an error condition. Further, in multiflag=.false. mode, the
          relaxed definition of "remove" also covers the case where there
          are multiple items in fieldbundle that match a single entry in
          fieldNameList. For relaxedflag=.false. this is treated as an
          error condition. The default setting is .false..

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
