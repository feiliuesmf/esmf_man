  25.5.14 ESMF_FieldBundleHalo - Execute a FieldBundle halo operation

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldBundleHalo(fieldbundle, routehandle, &
     checkflag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
         type(ESMF_FieldBundle), intent(inout) :: fieldbundle
         type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(inout) :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
         logical, intent(in), optional :: checkflag
         integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Execute a precomputed halo operation for the Fields in fieldbundle. The
   FieldBundle must match the respective FieldBundle used during
   ESMF_FieldBundleHaloStore() in type, kind, and memory layout of the
   gridded dimensions. However, the size, number, and index order of
   ungridded dimensions may be different. See section [737]37.2.5 for a
   more detailed discussion of RouteHandle reusability.

   See ESMF_FieldBundleHaloStore() on how to precompute routehandle.

   fieldbundle
          ESMF_FieldBundle with source data. The data in this FieldBundle
          may be destroyed by this call.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [checkflag]
          If set to .TRUE. the input FieldBundle pair will be checked for
          consistency with the precomputed operation provided by
          routehandle. If set to .FALSE. (default) only a very basic input
          check will be performed, leaving many inconsistencies
          undetected. Set checkflag to .FALSE. to achieve highest
          performance.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
