  51.6.10 ESMF_VMBarrier - VM wide barrier

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_VMBarrier(vm, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_VM),  intent(in),  optional :: vm
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,        intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        8.1.0
                Made argument vm optional to simplify usage when calling
                on the current VM.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Collective ESMF_VM communication call that blocks calling PET until all
   PETs of the VM context have issued the call.

   The arguments are:

   [vm]
          ESMF_VM object. Default use current VM.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
