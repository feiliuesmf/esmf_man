  53.4.14 ESMF_UtilIOUnitGet - Scan for a free I/O unit number

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_UtilIOUnitGet(unit, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     integer, intent(out)           :: unit
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer, intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Scan for, and return, a free Fortran I/O unit number. By default, the
   range of unit numbers returned is between 50 and 99 (parameters
   ESMF_LOG_FORTRAN_UNIT_NUMBER and ESMF_LOG_UPPER respectively.) When
   integrating ESMF into an application where these values conflict with
   other usages, the range of values may be moved by setting the optional
   IOUnitLower and IOUnitUpper arguments in the initial ESMF_Initialize()
   call with values in a safe, alternate, range.

   The Fortran unit number which is returned is not reserved in any way.
   Successive calls without intervening OPEN or CLOSE statements (or other
   means of connecting to units), might not return a unique unit number.
   It is recommended that an OPEN statement immediately follow the call to
   ESMF_IOUnitGet() to activate the unit.

   The arguments are:

   unit
          A Fortran I/O unit number.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
