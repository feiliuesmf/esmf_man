  26.7.2 ESMF_LocStreamGetFieldBounds - Get precomputed DE-local Fortran data
  array bounds for creating a Field from a LocStream and Fortran array

   INTERFACE:
     subroutine ESMF_LocStreamGetFieldBounds(locstream, &
         localDe, gridToFieldMap, &
         ungriddedLBound, ungriddedUBound, &
         totalLBound, totalUBound, totalCount, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_LocStream), intent(in)            :: locstream
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,              intent(in),  optional :: localDe
     integer,              intent(in),  optional :: gridToFieldMap(:)
     integer,              intent(in),  optional :: ungriddedLBound(:)
     integer,              intent(in),  optional :: ungriddedUBound(:)
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: totalLBound(:)
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: totalUBound(:)
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: totalCount(:)
     integer,              intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Compute the lower and upper bounds of Fortran data array that can later
   be used in FieldCreate interface to create a ESMF_Field from a
   ESMF_LocStream and the Fortran data array. For an example and
   associated documentation using this method see section [1036]26.3.9.

   The arguments are:

   locstream
          ESMF_LocStream.

   [localDe]
          Local DE for which information is requested.
          [0,..,localDeCount-1]. For localDeCount==1 the localDe argument
          may be omitted, in which case it will default to localDe=0.

   [gridToFieldMap]
          List with number of elements equal to 1. The list elements map
          the dimension of the locstream to a dimension in the field by
          specifying the appropriate field dimension index. The default is
          to map the locstream|s dimension against the lowest dimension of
          the field in sequence, i.e. gridToFieldMap = (/1/). The values
          of all gridToFieldMap entries must be greater than or equal to
          one and smaller than or equal to the field rank. The total
          ungridded dimensions in the field are the total field dimensions
          less the dimensions in the grid. Ungridded dimensions must be in
          the same order they are stored in the field.

   [ungriddedLBound]
          Lower bounds of the ungridded dimensions of the field. The
          number of elements in the ungriddedLBound is equal to the number
          of ungridded dimensions in the field. All ungridded dimensions
          of the field are also undistributed. When field dimension count
          is greater than 1, both ungriddedLBound and ungriddedUBound must
          be specified. When both are specified the values are checked for
          consistency. Note that the the ordering of these ungridded
          dimensions is the same as their order in the field.

   [ungriddedUBound]
          Upper bounds of the ungridded dimensions of the field. The
          number of elements in the ungriddedUBound is equal to the number
          of ungridded dimensions in the field. All ungridded dimensions
          of the field are also undistributed. When field dimension count
          is greater than 1, both ungriddedLBound and ungriddedUBound must
          be specified. When both are specified the values are checked for
          consistency. Note that the the ordering of these ungridded
          dimensions is the same as their order in the field.

   [totalLBound]
          The relative lower bounds of Fortran data array to be used later
          in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_LocStream and Fortran data array.
          This is an output variable from this user interface.

   [totalUBound]
          The relative upper bounds of Fortran data array to be used later
          in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_LocStream and Fortran data array.
          This is an output variable from this user interface.

   [totalCount]
          Number of elements need to be allocated for Fortran data array
          to be used later in ESMF_FieldCreate from ESMF_LocStream and
          Fortran data array. This is an output variable from this user
          interface.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
