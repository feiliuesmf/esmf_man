  53.4.3 ESMF_UtilGetArgIndex - Return the index of a command line argument

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_UtilGetArgIndex(argvalue, argindex, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     character(*), intent(in)            :: argvalue
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,      intent(out), optional :: argindex
     integer,      intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   This method searches for, and returns the index of a desired command
   line argument. An example might be to find a specific keyword (e.g.,
   -esmf_path) so that its associated value argument could be obtained by
   adding 1 to the argindex and calling ESMF_UtilGetArg().

   Some MPI implementations do not consistently provide command line
   arguments on PETs other than PET 0. It is therefore recommended that
   PET 0 call this method and broadcast the results to the other PETs by
   using the ESMF_VMBroadcast() method.

   The arguments are:

   argvalue
          A character string which will be searched for in the command
          line argument list.

   [argindex]
          If the value string is found, the position will be returned as a
          non-negative integer. If the string is not found, a negative
          value will be returned.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
