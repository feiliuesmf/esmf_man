  18.4.23 ESMF_CplCompSetVM - Call user routine to set CplComp VM properties

   INTERFACE:
   recursive subroutine ESMF_CplCompSetVM(cplcomp, userRoutine, &
     userRc, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_CplComp), intent(inout)         :: cplcomp
     interface
       subroutine userRoutine(cplcomp, rc)
         use ESMF_CompMod
         implicit none
         type(ESMF_CplComp)         :: cplcomp  ! must not be optional
         integer, intent(out)       :: rc       ! must not be optional
       end subroutine
     end interface
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,            intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,            intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Optionally call into user provided userRoutine which is responsible for
   setting Component's VM properties.

   The arguments are:

   cplcomp
          Coupler Component.

   userRoutine
          The Component writer must supply a subroutine with the exact
          interface shown above for the userRoutine argument. Arguments in
          userRoutine must not be declared as optional, and the types,
          intent and order must match. Prior to Fortran-2008, the
          subroutine must be either a module scope procedure, or an
          external procedure that has a matching interface block specified
          for it. An internal procedure which is contained within another
          procedure must not be used. From Fortran-2008 onwards, an
          internal procedure contained within either a main program or a
          module procedure may be used. If the internal procedure is
          contained within a module procedure, it is subject to
          initialization requirements. See: [294]16.4.9

          The subroutine, when called by the framework, is expected to use
          any of the ESMF_CplCompSetVMxxx() methods to set the properties
          of the VM associated with the Coupler Component.

   [userRc]
          Return code set by userRoutine before returning.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.

  18.4.24 ESMF_CplCompSetVM - Call user routine through name lookup, to set
  CplComp VM properties

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_CplCompSetVM()
   recursive subroutine ESMF_CplCompSetVMShObj(cplcomp, userRoutine, &
     sharedObj, userRoutineFound, userRc, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_CplComp),  intent(inout)         :: cplcomp
     character(len=*),    intent(in)            :: userRoutine
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     character(len=*),    intent(in),  optional :: sharedObj
     logical,             intent(out), optional :: userRoutineFound
     integer,             intent(out), optional :: userRc
     integer,             intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        8.4.0
                Added argument userRoutineFound. The new argument provides
                a way to test availability without causing error
                conditions.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Optionally call into user provided userRoutine which is responsible for
   setting Component's VM properties. The named userRoutine must exist in
   the executable, or in the shared object specified by sharedObj. In the
   latter case all of the platform specific details about dynamic linking
   and loading apply.

   The arguments are:

   cplcomp
          Coupler Component.

   userRoutine
          Routine to be called, specified as a character string. The
          Component writer must supply a subroutine with the exact
          interface shown for userRoutine below. Arguments must not be
          declared as optional, and the types, intent and order must
          match. Prior to Fortran-2008, the subroutine must be either a
          module scope procedure, or an external procedure that has a
          matching interface block specified for it. An internal procedure
          which is contained within another procedure must not be used.
          From Fortran-2008 onwards, an internal procedure contained
          within either a main program or a module procedure may be used.
          If the internal procedure is contained within a module
          procedure, it is subject to initialization requirements. See:
          [295]16.4.9

          INTERFACE:

       interface
         subroutine userRoutine(cplcomp, rc)
           type(ESMF_CplComp)   :: cplcomp     ! must not be optional
           integer, intent(out) :: rc          ! must not be optional
         end subroutine
       end interface

          DESCRIPTION:
          The subroutine, when called by the framework, is expected to use
          any of the ESMF_CplCompSetVMxxx() methods to set the properties
          of the VM associated with the Coupler Component.

   [sharedObj]
          Name of shared object that contains userRoutine. If the
          sharedObj argument is not provided the executable itself will be
          searched for userRoutine.

   [userRoutineFound]
          Report back whether the specified userRoutine was found and
          executed, or was not available. If this argument is present, not
          finding the userRoutine will not result in returning an error in
          rc. The default is to return an error if the userRoutine cannot
          be found.

   [userRc]
          Return code set by userRoutine before returning.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
