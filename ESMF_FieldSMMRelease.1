  26.6.74 ESMF_FieldSMMRelease - Release resources associated with Field

   sparse matrix multiplication

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_FieldSMMRelease(routehandle, noGarbage, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
         type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(inout)           :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
         logical,                intent(in),   optional  :: noGarbage
         integer,                intent(out),  optional  :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        8.0.0
                Added argument noGarbage. The argument provides a
                mechanism to override the default garbage collection
                mechanism when destroying an ESMF object.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Release resources associated with a Field sparse matrix multiplication.
   After this call routehandle becomes invalid.

   routehandle
          Handle to the precomputed Route.

   [noGarbage]
          If set to .TRUE. the object will be fully destroyed and removed
          from the ESMF garbage collection system. Note however that under
          this condition ESMF cannot protect against accessing the
          destroyed object through dangling aliases - a situation which
          may lead to hard to debug application crashes.

          It is generally recommended to leave the noGarbage argument set
          to .FALSE. (the default), and to take advantage of the ESMF
          garbage collection system which will prevent problems with
          dangling aliases or incorrect sequences of destroy calls.
          However this level of support requires that a small remnant of
          the object is kept in memory past the destroy call. This can
          lead to an unexpected increase in memory consumption over the
          course of execution in applications that use temporary ESMF
          objects. For situations where the repeated creation and
          destruction of temporary objects leads to memory issues, it is
          recommended to call with noGarbage set to .TRUE., fully removing
          the entire temporary object from memory.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
