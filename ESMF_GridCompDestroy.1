  17.4.5 ESMF_GridCompDestroy - Release resources associated with a GridComp

   INTERFACE:
   recursive subroutine ESMF_GridCompDestroy(gridcomp, &
     timeout, timeoutFlag, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_GridComp), intent(inout)          :: gridcomp
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,             intent(in),   optional :: timeout
     logical,             intent(out),  optional :: timeoutFlag
     integer,             intent(out),  optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.
     * This interface was modified since ESMF version 5.2.0r. The fact
       that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF
       version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions
       of this interface. If user code compatibility with version 5.2.0r
       is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this
       interface to features that were available in the 5.2.0r release.
       Changes made after the 5.2.0r release:

        5.3.0
                Added argument timeout. Added argument timeoutFlag. The
                new arguments provide access to the fault-tolerant
                component features.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Destroys an ESMF_GridComp, releasing the resources associated with the
   object.

   The arguments are:

   gridcomp
          Release all resources associated with this ESMF_GridComp and
          mark the object as invalid. It is an error to pass this object
          into any other routines after being destroyed.

   [timeout]
          The maximum period in seconds that this call will wait in
          communications with the actual component, before returning with
          a timeout condition. The default is 3600, i.e. 1 hour. The
          timeout argument is only supported for connected dual
          components.

   [timeoutFlag]
          Returns .true. if the timeout was reached, .false. otherwise. If
          timeoutFlag was not provided, a timeout condition will lead to a
          return code of rc \= ESMF_SUCCESS. Otherwise the return value of
          timeoutFlag is the sole indicator of a timeout condition.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
