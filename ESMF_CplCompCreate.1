  18.4.4 ESMF_CplCompCreate - Create a CplComp

   INTERFACE:
   recursive function ESMF_CplCompCreate(config, configFile, &
     clock, petList, contextflag, name, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_CplComp) :: ESMF_CplCompCreate

   ARGUMENTS:
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_Config),       intent(in),  optional :: config
     character(len=*),        intent(in),  optional :: configFile
     type(ESMF_Clock),        intent(in),  optional :: clock
     integer,                 intent(in),  optional :: petList(:)
     type(ESMF_Context_Flag), intent(in),  optional :: contextflag
     character(len=*),        intent(in),  optional :: name
     integer,                 intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   This interface creates an ESMF_CplComp object. By default, a separate
   VM context will be created for each component. This implies creating a
   new MPI communicator and allocating additional memory to manage the VM
   resources. When running on a large number of processors, creating a
   separate VM for each component could be both time and memory
   inefficient. If the application is sequential, i.e., each component is
   running on all the PETs of the global VM, it will be more efficient to
   use the global VM instead of creating a new one. This can be done by
   setting contextflag to ESMF_CONTEXT_PARENT_VM.

   The return value is the new ESMF_CplComp.

   The arguments are:

   [config]
          An already-created ESMF_Config object to be attached to the
          newly created component. If both config and configFile arguments
          are specified, config takes priority.

   [configFile]
          The filename of an ESMF_Config format file. If specified, a new
          ESMF_Config object is created and attached to the newly created
          component. The configFile file is opened and associated with the
          new config object. If both config and configFile arguments are
          specified, config takes priority.

   [clock]
          Component-specific ESMF_Clock. This clock is available to be
          queried and updated by the new ESMF_CplComp as it chooses. This
          should not be the parent component clock, which should be
          maintained and passed down to the initialize/run/finalize
          routines separately.

   [petList]
          List of parent PETs given to the created child component by the
          parent component. If petList is not specified, or is empty, all
          of the parent PETs are given to the child component. The order
          of PETs in petList determines how the child local PETs map back
          to the parent PETs.

   [contextflag]
          Specify the component's VM context. The default context is
          ESMF_CONTEXT_OWN_VM. See section [282]54.10 for a complete list
          of valid flags.

   [name]
          Name of the newly-created ESMF_CplComp. This name can be altered
          from within the ESMF_CplComp code once the initialization
          routine is called.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
