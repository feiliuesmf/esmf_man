   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Create an ESMF_DELayout object on the basis of optionally provided
   restrictions. By default a DELayout with deCount equal to petCount will
   be created, each DE mapped to a single PET. However, the number of DEs
   as well grouping of DEs and PETs can be specified via the optional
   arguments.

   The arguments are:

   [deCount]
          Number of DEs to be provided by the created DELayout. By default
          the number of DEs equals the number of PETs in the associated VM
          context. Specifying a deCount smaller than the number of PETs
          will result in unassociated PETs. This may be used to share VM
          resources between DELayouts within the same ESMF component.
          Specifying a deCount greater than the number of PETs will result
          in multiple DE to PET mapping.

   [deGrouping]
          This optional argument must be of size deCount. Its content
          assigns a DE group index to each DE of the DELayout. A group
          index of -1 indicates that the associated DE isn't member of any
          particular group. The significance of DE groups is that all the
          DEs belonging to a certain group will be mapped against the same
          PET. This does not, however, mean that DEs belonging to
          different DE groups must be mapped to different PETs.

   [pinflag]
          This flag specifies which type of resource DEs are pinned to.
          The default is to pin DEs to PETs. Alternatively it is also
          possible to pin DEs to VASs. See section [599]50.2.1 for a list
          of valid pinning options.

   [petList]
          List specifying PETs to be used by this DELayout. This can be
          used to control the PET overlap between DELayouts within the
          same ESMF component. It is erroneous to specify PETs that are
          not within the provided VM context. The default is to include
          all the PETs of the VM.

   [vm]
          If present, the DELayout object is created on the specified
          ESMF_VM object. The default is to create on the VM of the
          current context.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.

  50.6.5 ESMF_DELayoutCreate - Create DELayout from petMap

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_DELayoutCreate()
   recursive function ESMF_DELayoutCreateFromPetMap(petMap, &
     pinflag, vm, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_DELayout) :: ESMF_DELayoutCreateFromPetMap

   ARGUMENTS:
     integer,                      intent(in)            :: petMap(:)
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     type(ESMF_Pin_Flag),          intent(in),  optional :: pinflag
     type(ESMF_VM),                intent(in),  optional :: vm
     integer,                      intent(out), optional :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Create an ESMF_DELayout with exactly specified DE to PET mapping.

   This ESMF method must be called in unison by all PETs of the VM.
   Calling this method from a PET not part of the VM or not calling it
   from a PET that is part of the VM will result in undefined behavior.
   ESMF does not guard against violation of the unison requirement. The
   call is not collective, there is no communication between PETs.

   The arguments are:

   petMap
          List specifying the DE-to-PET mapping. The list elements
          correspond to DE 0, 1, 2, ... and map against the specified PET
          of the VM context. The size of the petMap argument determines
          the number of DEs in the created DELayout. It is erroneous to
          specify a PET identifier that lies outside the VM context.

   [pinflag]
          This flag specifies which type of resource DEs are pinned to.
          The default is to pin DEs to PETs. Alternatively it is also
          possible to pin DEs to VASs. See section [600]50.2.1 for a list
          of valid pinning options.

   [vm]
          If present, the DELayout object is created on the specified
          ESMF_VM object. The default is to create on the VM of the
          current context.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
