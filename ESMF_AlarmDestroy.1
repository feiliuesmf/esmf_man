       subroutine ESMF_AlarmDestroy(alarm, rc)

     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting

       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current

   ESMF_Alarm from its associated ESMF_Clock's list of ESMF_Alarms
   (removes the ESMF_Alarm pointer from the list).

   The arguments are:

   alarm
          Release resources associated with this ESMF_Alarm and mark the
          object as invalid. It is an error to pass this object into any
          other routines after being destroyed.
