  17.4.8 ESMF_GridCompGetInternalState - Get private data block pointer

   INTERFACE:
   subroutine ESMF_GridCompGetInternalState(gridcomp, wrappedDataPointer, rc)

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_GridComp)             :: gridcomp
     type(wrapper)                   :: wrappedDataPointer
     integer,            intent(out) :: rc

   STATUS:
     * This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting
       at 5.2.0r. If code using this interface compiles with any version
       of ESMF starting with 5.2.0r, then it will compile with the current
       version.

   DESCRIPTION:

   Available to be called by an ESMF_GridComp at any time after
   ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState has been called. Since init, run, and
   finalize must be separate subroutines, data that they need to share in
   common can either be module global data, or can be allocated in a
   private data block and the address of that block can be registered with
   the framework and retrieved by this call. When running multiple
   instantiations of an ESMF_GridComp, for example during ensemble runs,
   it may be simpler to maintain private data specific to each run with
   private data blocks. A corresponding ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState call
   sets the data pointer to this block, and this call retrieves the data
   pointer. Note that the wrappedDataPointer argument needs to be a
   derived type which contains only a pointer of the type of the data
   block defined by the user. When making this call the pointer needs to
   be unassociated. When the call returns, the pointer will now reference
   the original data block which was set during the previous call to
   ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState.

   Only the last data block set via ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState will be
   accessible.

   CAUTION: If you are working with a compiler that does not support
   Fortran 2018 assumed-type dummy arguments, then this method does not
   have an explicit Fortran interface. In this case do not specify
   argument keywords when calling this method!

   The arguments are:

   gridcomp
          An ESMF_GridComp object.

   wrappedDataPointer
          A derived type (wrapper), containing only an unassociated
          pointer to the private data block. The framework will fill in
          the pointer. When this call returns, the pointer is set to the
          same address set during the last ESMF_GridCompSetInternalState
          call. This level of indirection is needed to reliably set and
          retrieve the data block no matter which architecture or compiler
          is used.

   rc
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors. Note:
          unlike most other ESMF routines, this argument is not optional
          because of implementation considerations.
