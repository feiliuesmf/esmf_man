  37.5.1 ESMF_RouteHandleCreate - Create a new RouteHandle from RouteHandle

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_RouteHandleCreate()
   function ESMF_RouteHandleCreateRH(routehandle, &
     originPetList, targetPetList, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle) :: ESMF_RouteHandleCreateRH

   ARGUMENTS:
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle), intent(in)            :: routehandle
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,                intent(in),  optional :: originPetList(:)
     integer,                intent(in),  optional :: targetPetList(:)
     integer,                intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Create a new ESMF_RouteHandle object from and existing RouteHandle. The
   new RouteHandle can be created to function on a different petList than
   the incoming RouteHandle.

   The arguments are:

   routehandle
          The RouteHandle object to be duplicated.

   [originPetList]
          The petList on which the incoming routehandle is defined to
          operate. If present, then targetPetList must also be present and
          of the same size. The petLists are used to map origin PETs to
          target PETs. By convention the petLists are constructed to first
          list the PETs of the source component, followed by the PETs of
          the destination component. Defaults, to the petList of the
          current component context, meaning that the PETs in the
          RouteHandle are not modified.

   [targetPetList]
          The petList on which the newly created RouteHandle is defined to
          operate. If present, then originPetList must also be present and
          of the same size. The petLists are used to map origin PETs to
          target PETs. By convention the petLists are constructed to first
          list the PETs of the source component, followed by the PETs of
          the destination component. Defaults, to the petList of the
          current component context, meaning that the PETs in the
          RouteHandle are not modified.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.

  37.5.2 ESMF_RouteHandleCreate - Create a new RouteHandle from file

   INTERFACE:
   ! Private name; call using ESMF_RouteHandleCreate()
   function ESMF_RouteHandleCreateFile(fileName, rc)

   RETURN VALUE:
     type(ESMF_RouteHandle) :: ESMF_RouteHandleCreateFile

   ARGUMENTS:
     character(*),           intent(in)            :: fileName
 -- The following arguments require argument keyword syntax (e.g. rc=rc). --
     integer,                intent(out), optional :: rc

   DESCRIPTION:

   Create a new ESMF_RouteHandle object from a file. This method must be
   called from a VM context that holds exactly as many PETs as were used
   when generating the file.

   The arguments are:

   fileName
          The name of the RouteHandle file to be read in.

   [rc]
          Return code; equals ESMF_SUCCESS if there are no errors.
